# The Daily Tarot

This app allows the user the pull a randomized card from a standard 77-card tarot deck. A local image is then matched to the selected card from the API and displayed on screen with it's meaning and description. The user then has the option to save their response with their intitials and an emoji react in a Firebase database. The saved info is then pulled from the database and displayed in the "Saved Responses" section. The viewer can see up to 24 saved responses at a time.
